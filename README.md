# 🖼️ CIFAR-10 Image Classification with CNN

A deep learning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to classify images from the **CIFAR-10 dataset** with **95% accuracy**, leveraging **preprocessing**, **data augmentation**, and **hyperparameter tuning** for improved generalization.

---

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a CNN to classify **60,000 images** from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 categories.  
The model achieves **95% test accuracy** by:
- Applying **data preprocessing** & normalization
- Performing **image augmentation** to reduce overfitting
- Conducting **hyperparameter optimization** for training efficiency

---

## ✨ Features
- 🔹 Image preprocessing & normalization
- 🔹 Advanced augmentation (rotation, shift, flip, zoom)
- 🔹 Hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, batch size, optimizer, depth)
- 🔹 Accuracy tracking & performance visualization
